W 2024,CH EN 285 ,176000000000.0,Question: Additional comments,Dr. Guymon is understandably very busy with his various responsibilities. He usually sat in the corner of the lab working on projects or other work and was available for consulting as needed if students approached him  and he is very good at helping students seeking help. There was one time he was in the UO lab with us adding methocel into our non-newtonian fluid lab equipment where he took the time to explain in detail aspects of the labs parameters  history  and other aspects that were not in the lab write-up. There were some equipment and procedures he showed us too that went the extra mile to show us the context of process equipment and became a personal mentor for us for a few minutes. We really enjoyed that  and wished to see that effort for personal interaction and mentoring while completing our other labs rather than just fulfilling his supervisory and consulting roles as lab professor. It doesn''t need to be all the time  but if he joined groups and worked with them for a few minutes (or a half/whole lab) while making sure TAs were available to help the others (he can always step away as needed)  I think that would have enriched the experience significantly. Students could ask deeper questions  develop greater personal connections  and gain experience from his wisdom while he interacts with them.

W 2024,CH EN 311 ,291000000000.0,Question: Explained concepts effectively,Dr Guymon really cares about instruction and I think he can improve this skill. Often his instruction style was writing notes on an iPad during class and then sharing those notes. However  I found this difficult to follow during class and difficult to decipher afterwards. It was sometimes not easily legible and unorganized. I would have preferred typed notes that we annotate during class  or notes formatted similarly to the github site (latex is always legible). Alternatively  if the point is for us to take notes on our own  I feel the instruction could be formatted in a more linear  organized fashion to allow us to take notes. In my experience  having an excellent textbook and working problems from it helps my learning more than almost anything else. Lecture is sometimes difficult for me to focus  but if I can go over the concepts by reading them in the textbook (or even prepare by reading before class) and then work problems  the concepts are cemented far more firmly in my brain. Unfortunately  I did not like the textbook we used in this class. I felt it was dense and didn''t explain math very well. I also appreciate when textbooks give answers to at least odd questions so I can check them myself. I often don''t go back to look at answer keys for homework that instructors create  but if the answers are in the back of the book  I will check every problem.

He would share personal stories and have<br>great spiritual thoughts. He listened and adapted<br>to our midcourse feedback and made changes to the<br>structure of the class accordingly. For example<br>many students asked for more example problems so<br>professor Guymon changed the lectures to always go<br>over examples. My only big complaint surrounding<br>the class is that exam problems were sometimes<br>seemed to be a completely different type of<br>question surrounding a topic than what we did<br>prior. I understand the importance of this to<br>actually be able to apply understandings in a new<br>way  but I would get frustrated seeing some of the<br>problems on the exams because I thought that I was<br>going in prepared just to find out I wasn''t. My<br>next complaint is just about the course. It felt<br>like there were too many topics that had to be<br>covered that were very different from each other.<br>Every day just felt like another big topic. It<br>seemed like the course overall just had too many<br>big and small topics that are all important enough<br>to be mentioned  but this made it extremely<br>difficult to fully understand topics as well as<br>understand which topics would likely show up on<br>exams.

For the bioreactor lab  my<br>team was putting in 12+ hours each week outside of<br>the 6 scheduled hours for the lab. The cat meth<br>lab was easily completed during class and only<br>required maybe 1-2 hours outside of class. The PBL<br>probably required about 3  since group of teams<br>had one day less than the other group because of<br>the schedule  which ended up with us having to<br>rush a lot and stay afterwards to finish building<br>things  coding in LabView  and putting together<br>the documents required for the lab. I think the<br>bioreactor lab needs to be either redesigned or<br>simplified if possible. Everyone who did it had to<br>invest a lot of time into setting things up and<br>collecting data. It was to the point where we far<br>exceeded the expectation of only spending 25 hours<br>total on a lab. This definitely wasn''t Dr.<br>Guymon''s fault though  as I think a group of<br>people designed the bioreactor lab. But it does<br>need some revision.

I liked the stats quizzes because they were straightforward and I liked the engineering fundamentals because it felt nice to get credit for writing out those ideas  and it made me feel adequate at something. I didn''t like the fundamentals quizzes--they were too nebulous. I wish we''d done reviews like we did with stats  where we reviewed the equation/concepts the class before the quiz. It was hard to see the demos sometimes  I should have moved  but it was also really stressful sometimes to have the time limits when I can''t even remember what concept goes with the demo. I think a few more puzzle pieces provided in those would have been better; however grading on them was relatively merciful and adequate extra credit was provided. I wished the ""rubric"" function of learning suite was better utilized--at least sometimes our scores felt a little arbitrary and I''m sure the instructor had reasons I just wish I understood them better for some of the scores. I felt like it was frustrating to get marked down because we didn''t get the same values the instructor got or we didn''t get a number we were ""supposed to  this is a lab... unless the instructor can repeat that experiment several times and always gets that answer, and our procedures are specified extremely specifically, it''s kind of strange to grade based off of what number we got.
