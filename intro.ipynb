    "Clint Guymon, PhD, PE is an associate teaching professor in the Chemical Engineering Department at Brigham Young University. He received his doctorate degree in chemical engineering at Brigham Young University. His doctoral thesis was on molecular dynamics simulation and experimental studies on copper electrodeposition (see [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/333/](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/333/)). He subsequently worked at Intel as a process engineer and then for 15 years at [Safety Management Services](https://smsenergetics.com/) as an engineering consultant. A brief summary of some of his work experience is given at this site: [https://www.clintguymon.dev/](https://www.clintguymon.dev/)."

    "\n",
    "Students have left me over 1600 comments. Student comments are from the end of semester teacher ratings that they are asked to complete. The comments range from negative to mixed to positive. I've used Google's generative ai package [as given here with the comments on this Kaggle sheet](https://www.kaggle.com/code/molecman/student-comment-analysis) to generate a sentiment (positive, etc.) for each comment. The classification is not perfect as there are some positive comments that are labeled negative and vice versa. The below plot is a representation of the similarity between comments based on embeddings and tSNE reduction. You can mouse over the figure to see the comment at that point. The comments are colored by the sentiment classification. "

He usually sat in the<br>corner of the lab working on projects or other<br>work and was available for consulting as needed if<br>students approached him  and he is very good at<br>helping students seeking help. There was one time<br>he was in the UO lab with us adding methocel into<br>our non-newtonian fluid lab equipment where he<br>took the time to explain in detail aspects of the<br>labs parameters  history  and other aspects that<br>were not in the lab write-up. There were some<br>equipment and procedures he showed us too that<br>went the extra mile to show us the context of<br>process equipment and became a personal mentor for<br>us for a few minutes. We really enjoyed that  and<br>wished to see that effort for personal interaction<br>and mentoring while completing our other labs<br>rather than just fulfilling his supervisory and<br>consulting roles as lab professor. It doesn''t<br>need to be all the time  but if he joined groups<br>and worked with them for a few minutes (or a<br>half/whole lab) while making sure TAs were<br>available to help the others (he can always step<br>away as needed)  I think that would have enriched<br>the experience significantly. Students could ask<br>deeper questions  develop greater personal<br>connections  and gain experience from his wisdom<br>while he interacts with them. Dr. Guymon would<br>also be able to see hands on a better perspective<br>of how the labs actually run with users and be<br>able to make tweaks to assignments (wording<br>format  procedures  order  help etc) that would<br>otherwise be missed in high-level surveys near<br>semester''s end."
