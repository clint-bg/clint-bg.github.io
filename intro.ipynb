    "I am an associate teaching professor in the Chemical Engineering Department at Brigham Young University. Previously, I received a doctorate degree in chemical engineering at Brigham Young University with my doctoral thesis treating molecular dynamics simulation and experimental studies on copper electrodeposition (see [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/333/](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/333/)). I then worked at Intel as a process engineer followed by work for 15 years at [Safety Management Services](https://smsenergetics.com/) as an engineering consultant. A brief summary of some of my work experience is given at this site: [https://www.clintguymon.dev/](https://www.clintguymon.dev/)."
