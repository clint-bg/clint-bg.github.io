# Community Involvement
Some associations I have been involved with include the ASEE, ETUG, T4L, AIChE, and local schools.

## ASEE
The [American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)](https://www.asee.org/) is a professional association for engineering educators. 

## ETUG
The [Explosives Testing Users Group (ETUG)](https://etusersgroup.org/) is a group of engineers and scientists in private and government laboratories that work to improve the reproducibility and application of small and large-scale testing of propellants, pyrotechnics, and explosives. I have been involved with this group for over 15 years. 

## T4L
The [Teaching 4 Learning (T4L)](https://www.byui.edu/teaching-for-learning/) group is a group of faculty and staff at universities in the west that gather together to discuss teaching and learning methodologies.

## AIChE
The [American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)](https://www.aiche.org/) is a professional association for chemical engineers. I mentor a ChemE Car team for the AIChE student chapter at BYU.

# WERC
The [WERC](https://iee.nmsu.edu/) is an environmental design contest for students to solve real-world problems. Students work to develop a working bench-top prototype, report, cost analysis, presentation, and poster. I mentor a team for this competition.

## Local Schools
I have worked with local schools such as the McGillis School in helping to educate future engineers.

## BYU Chemical Engineering Department
I am the safety representative for the department and work with the faculty and staff to ensure a safe working and learning environment for both graduate and undergraduate students.
