# Community Involvement
Some associations I have been involved with include the ASEE, ETUG, T4L, AIChE, and local schools.

## ASEE
The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is a professional association for engineering educators. 

## ETUG
The Explosives Testing Users Group (ETUG) is a group of engineers and scientists in private and government laboratories that work to improve the reproducibility and application of small and large-scale testing of propellants, pyrotechnics, and explosives. I have been involved with this group for over 15 years. 

## T4L
The Teaching for Learning (T4L) group is a group of faculty and staff at universities in the west that gather together to discuss teaching and learning methodologies.

## AIChE
The American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is a professional association for chemical engineers.

## Local Schools
I have worked with local schools such as the McGillis School in helping to educate future engineers.
