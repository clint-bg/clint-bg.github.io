<h1>Clint Guymon<a class="headerlink" href="#clint-guymon" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Clint Guymon, PhD, PE is an associate teaching professor in the Chemical Engineering Department at Brigham Young University. He received his doctorate degree in chemical engineering at Brigham Young University. His doctoral thesis was on molecular dynamics simulation and experimental studies on copper electrodeposition (see <a class="reference external" href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/333/">https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/333/</a>). He subsequently worked at Intel as a process engineer and then for 15 years at <a class="reference external" href="https://smsenergetics.com/">Safety Management Services</a> as an engineering consultant. A brief summary of some of his work experience is given at this site: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.clintguymon.dev/">https://www.clintguymon.dev/</a>.</p>

<h2>Student Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#student-comments" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Students have left me over 1600 comments. Student comments are from the end of semester teacher ratings that they are asked to complete. The comments range from negative to mixed to positive. I’ve used Google’s generative ai package <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/molecman/student-comment-analysis">as given here with the comments on this Kaggle sheet</a> to generate a sentiment (positive, etc.) for each comment. The classification is not perfect as there are some positive comments that are labeled negative and vice versa. The below plot is a representation of the similarity between comments based on embeddings and tSNE reduction. You can mouse over the figure to see the comment at that point. The comments are colored by the sentiment classification.</p>
